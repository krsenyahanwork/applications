dealing with large dataset or redundant variables
  - lasso regression
  - data reduction such as PCA
  - exploration:

ways to deal with imbalanced dataset
  - replace evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score
     - precision: goal is to have a high precision value
     - recall: goal is to have a high recall value
     - f1-score:goal is to have a high f1-score value
    ROC curve for precision and recall, cohens kappa, confusion matrix
